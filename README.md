## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You'll also need to install the following Python packages:

- Selenium
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup4
- WebDriver Manager for Selenium

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium pandas beautifulsoup4 webdriver-manager
```

### Setting Up the WebDriver

This project uses `webdriver-manager` to handle the WebDriver installation. This helps in managing the ChromeDriver required for Selenium.

## Usage

### Running the Script

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-automation.git
cd amazon-automation
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python amazon_scraper.py
```

The script will open a Chrome browser, navigate through the Amazon search result pages, and scrape product information based on the specified query.

### Customizing the Query

You can change the search query by modifying the `query` variable in `amazon_scraper.py`.
